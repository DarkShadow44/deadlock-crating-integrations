# Deadlock Crating Integrations For Bob's Mods

Adds 2 tiers to match with Bob's Logistics extra belts, and more closely ties crating machines to their little sisters, the belt boxes.

Does not require Bob's Logistics mod, but, as it's intended to be a rebalance for Bob's Mods, you may find it odd to have extra tiers of crating machines otherwise

Updates crafting speeds of existing crating machines to respect the belt overhaul belt speed setting. Updates recipes for crating machines to use belt boxes as ingredients and be a little more balanced for Bob's Mods
